# Iris-Classification
The Iris dataset is a popular choice for classification tasks in machine learning. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of iris flowers belonging to three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on these four features. This is a supervised learning problem, as we have labeled data with the correct species for each sample. Since we are predicting a categorical variable (the species), this is a classification task.

We will explore different classification algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and logistic regression, to determine which model performs best on the Iris dataset. By the end of this project, we aim to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers based on their measurements.
